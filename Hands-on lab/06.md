## Exercise 5: Building the Power BI dashboard

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have the solution deployed and exchanging messages, you can build a Power BI dashboard that monitors the sentiments of the messages being exchanged in real time. The following steps walk through the creation of the dashboard.

### Task 1: Provision Power BI

If you do not already have a Power BI account:

1. Go to <https://powerbi.microsoft.com/features/>.

2. Scroll down until you see the **Try Power BI for free!** section of the page, and select the **Try Free** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Power BI Try for free section.](media/setup3.png "Power BI Try for free section")

3. On the page, enter your work email address (which should be the same account as the one you use for your Azure subscription), and select **Sign up**.

    ![The Get started page has a field for entering your work email address.](media/setup4.png "Get started page")

4. Follow the on-screen prompts, and your Power BI environment should be ready within minutes. You can always return to it via <https://app.powerbi.com/>.

### Task 2: Create the static dashboard

1. Sign in to your Power BI subscription (<https://app.powerbi.com>).

2. Select **My Workspace** on the left-hand menu, then select the **Datasets** tab. Depending on your Power BI version, it may read **Datasets + dataflows**.

    ![In the Power BI window, on the left menu, My Workspace is selected. In the right pane, the Datasets tab is selected.](media/image140.png "Power BI window")

3. Under the **Datasets** (or **Datasets + dataflows**) list, select the **Messages** dataset.

    ![On the Datasets tab, the Messages dataset is highlighted in the table.](media/image141.png "Datasets tab")

4. Select the **Create report** button after clicking the three dots.

    ![On the Datasets + dataflows tab, the Create Report button is selected.](media/create-report-from-messages.png "Datasets + dataflows tab")

5. On the **Visualizations** palette, select **Gauge** to create a semi-circular gauge.

    ![On the Visualizations palette, the Gauge icon is highlighted.](media/image143.png "Visualizations palette")

6. In the **Fields** listing, select and drag the **score** field and drop it onto the **Value** field.

    ![In the Visualizations blade, the Gauge is selected. From the Fields blade under Messages, the score check box is selected. An arrow points from this to the Value field in the Visualizations pane indicating a drag and drop operation. Score is now listed as the Value in Visualizations.](media/image144.png "Visualizations and Fields listings")

7. Select the drop-down menu that appears where you dropped score and select **Average**.

    ![Average is selected from the Value drop down box in the Visualizations blade.](media/image145.png "Drop-down menu")

8. You now should have a gauge that shows the average sentiment for all the data collected so far, which should look similar to the following. If you have not sent many messages, the average sentiment may be a negative value, as the chat processor set a sentiment of -1 before you implemented proper Text Analytics sentiment analysis.

    ![A semi-circle gauge graph displays for Average of score, which is 0.62.](media/image146.png "Gauge graph")

9. From the **File** menu, select **Save** to save your visualization to a new report.

    ![On the toolbar the File menu is expanded and Save (Save this report) is selected.](media/image147.png "File menu")

10. Enter `ChatSentiment` for the report name, and select **Save**.

    ![In the Save your report window, ChatSentiment is typed in as the name of the report.](media/image148.png "Save your report window")

### Task 3: Create the real-time dashboard

This gauge is currently a static visualization. You will use the report just created to seed a dashboard whose visualizations update as new messages arrive.

1. Select the **Pin to a dashboard** item located on the toolbar. You will need to select the three dots to find this item.

    ![On the toolbar, the Pin to a dashboard button is selected.](media/pin-gauge-to-dashboard.png "Gauge control menu bar")

2. Select **New dashboard**, enter `Real-time Sentiment` as the name, and select **Pin Live**.

    ![On the Pin to dashboard dialog box, on the left, a Preview of the ChatSentiment Gauge graph displays. On the right, under Where would you like to pin to, the New dashboard radio button is selected.](media/2019-06-21-09-41-59.png "Pin to dashboard dialog box")

3. Return to the **My Workspace** page, and select your newly created dashboard from the list of dashboards.

    ![My Workspace dashboards list is displayed with the Real-time Sentiment dashboard selected.](media/image151.png 'My Workspace dashboards')

4. Real-time dashboards are created in Power BI using the Q&A feature, by typing in a question to visualize in the space provided. In the **Ask a question about your data** field, enter: `average score created between yesterday and today`.

    ![The input text box placeholder texts states Ask a question about your data.](media/2019-03-21-10-26-35.png "Ask a question about your data")

    ![average score created between yesterday and today is typed in the Ask question about your data textbox. An average of score (0.62) displays below.](media/image152.png "Ask question about your data field")

5. Next, convert this to a Gauge chart by expanding the **Visualizations** palette at right, and selecting on the **Gauge** control. You will need to set the **New Q&A experience** to **Off** in order to see the **Visualizations** palette. This switch is on the toolbar on the right-hand side.

    ![The Visualizations palette expand button is selected.](media/image153.png "Visualizations palette")

6. In the **Visualizations** palette, select the **Gauge** control. Select the **Format** (paint roller) icon and expand the **Gauge axis** section. Format the Gauge axis so it ranges between **0.0** and **1.0** and has a **target** (indicator) set at **0.5**.

    ![On the Visualizations palette, the Gauge graph icon is selected. Beneath that, the brush icon is selected. Under Gauge axis, the following values are defined: Min, 0. Max, 1.0. Target, 0.5.](media/image154.png "Visualizations list")

7. Your gauge should now look similar to the following:

    ![The Gauge graph for average score created between yesterday and today displays with an average of score of 0.62.](media/image155.png "Gauge graph")

8. In the top-right corner, select **Pin visual**.

    ![Pin visual option from the toolbar.](media/image156.png "Pin visual option")

9. In the dialog that appears, select the dashboard you recently created and select **Pin**.

    ![On the Pin to dashboard dialog box, on the left, a Preview of the Gauge graph displays. On the right, under Where would you like to pin to, the Existing dashboard radio button is selected.](media/image157.png "Pin to dashboard dialog box")

10. In the list of dashboards, select your **Real-time Sentiment** dashboard. Your new gauge should appear next to your original gauge. If the original gauge fills the whole screen, you may need to scroll down to see the new gauge. You can delete the original gauge if you prefer. (Select the top of the visualization, then ellipses that appear, and then, the trash can icon.)

    ![Two Average of score Gauge graphs display, and both share the same data.](media/image158.png "Gauge graphs")

11. Navigate to the chat website you deployed and send some messages and observe how the sentiment gauge updates with moments of you sending chat messages.

### Task 4: Add a trending sentiment chart to the dashboard

The sentiment visualization you created is great for getting a sense of sentiment as of this moment. However, First Up Consultants wishes to view sentiment over time for historical reference and to see whether overall sentiment is trending one way or another. To do this, we will use the tumbling window query output from Stream Analytics to display this data in a line chart.

1. While still in **Power BI**, select **My Workspace** once again, then select the **Datasets** (or **Datasets + dataflows**) tab. You should see the **TrendingSentiment** dataset dynamically created by Stream Analytics. Select the **Create Report** action.

    ![Go to My Workspace, then the Datasets tab, the TrendingSentiment dataset is listed, the Create Report button is selected next to this dataset.](media/create-report-trending-sentiment-dataset.png "Power BI Datasets")

2. Select the **Line chart** visualization.

    ![In the Visualizations palette, the Line chart visualization is selected.](media/power-bi-line-chart-visualization.png "Power BI Line Chart")

3. Drag the **average** field to the **Values** setting, and **snapshot** to **Axis**.

    ![Arrows indicating drag and drop operations show average in the Values field and snapshot in the Axis field.](media/power-bi-line-chart-settings.png "Power BI Line Chart")

4. Resize the line chart and observe how the average sentiment is tracked over time.

    ![Screenshot of the line chart displaying trending sentiment over time.](media/power-bi-trending-sentiment-chart.png "Power BI Line Chart")

5. Select **Save this report** on the top of the page. Name the report `Trending Sentiment` when prompted.

    ![The Save icon is selected from the toolbar.](media/power-bi-save-report.png "Save this report")

6. Next, select **Pin to a dashboard**.

    ![The Pin to a dashboard button is selected from the toolbar.](media/pin-to-dashboard.png "Pin to a dashboard")

7. In the **Pin to dashboard** dialog, select **Existing dashboard**, select the dashboard you created previously, then select **Pin live**.

    ![The Pin to dashboard dialog shows the report will be pinned to an existing dashboard and has the Real-time Sentiment dashboard selected in a drop down list.](media/power-bi-pin-to-dashboard.png "Pin to dashboard")

8. Position the Trending Sentiment line chart beneath the average score gauge.

    ![Power BI dashboard showing the average score gauges and trending sentiment.](media/power-bi-dashboard-with-trending-sentiment.png "Power BI Dashboard")

9. Try building out the rest of the real-time dashboard that should look as follows. We provide the following Q&A questions you can use to get started.

    ![The Power BI dashboard has four panes: two Count of Messages panes, an Average Sentiment, and Upset Users. The first Count of Messages pane displays a number (18). The second Count of Messages is a pie chart broken out by username. The Average Sentiment is a donut chart displaying the Average Sentiment (0.58) in the past 24 hours. Upset Users chart is a horizontal bar chart displaying the average of upset users (0.25) in the past 24 hours.](media/image159.png "Power BI Dashboard")

    - Count of Messages (Card visualization): Count of messages between yesterday and today.

    - Count of Messages by Username (Pie chart visualization): Count of messages by username between yesterday and today.

    - Upset Users (Bar chart visualization): Average score by username between yesterday and today.

10. Invite some peers to chat and monitor the sentiments using your new, real-time dashboard.
