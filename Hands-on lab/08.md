## Exercise 7: Add a bot using Bot service and QnA Maker

Duration: 30 minutes

At this point, you have created a real-time chat service in Azure, allowing people to interact with one another. Now we will build a bot that will automatically respond to user questions, helping take the load off the hotel staff.

### Task 1: Create a QnA service instance in Azure

Microsoft's QnAMaker is a Cognitive Service tool that uses your existing content to build and train a simple question and answer bot that responds to users in a natural, conversational way.

1. In a new web browser window, navigate to <https://www.qnamaker.ai>.

2. On the home page, select **Sign In** on the top right of the page. Sign in with the same credentials you use for the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    ![Microsoft QnA Maker home page is displayed, the Sign In link in the upper right corner of the screen is highlighted.](media/qna-maker-home.png "QnA Maker home page")

3. Select **Create a knowledge base**.

    ![The QnA Maker dashboard is displayed. It indicates that there are no knowledge bases. The Create a knowledge base item is selected from the toolbar menu.](media/qna-maker-create-kb-link.png "Select create a knowledge base")

4. Within the **knowledge base creation** page, select **Create a QnA Service** under Step 1. Ensure that you configure the **Stable** tier.

    ![Step 1 indicates to Create a QnA service in Microsoft Azure. There is a button labeled Create a QnA Service. It is configured with the Stable tier.](media/create-qna-maker-stable.png "Knowledge base creation page")

5. Within the **Create QnA Maker** form in Azure, provide the following:

    - **Subscription**: Choose the same subscription you used previously.

    - **Resource Group**: Choose the **intelligent-analytics** resource group.

    - **Name**: Provide a **unique name** for the QnA Maker Service (e.g., **awhotel-qna-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**).

    - **Pricing tier**: Choose **Free F0 (3 managed documents per month ...**

    - **Azure Search location**: Choose the **same location** you used previously. If the region you've been using isn't available, select a different location for this resource.

    - **Azure Search pricing tier**: Choose **Free F (3 Indexes)**.

    - **App name**: Provide a **unique name** for the QnA Maker Service (e.g., `awhotel-qna`).

    - **Website location**: Choose the **same location** you used previously. If the region you've been using isn't available, select a different location for this resource.

    - **App insights**: Select **Disable**.

    ![The Create QnA Maker form is shown populated with the preceding values.](media/qna-maker-details.png "Create QnA Maker")

6. Select **Review + create** and **Create**.

7. Once the service has been created, switch back to the browser tab with the **QnA Maker knowledge base creation** page and select the **Refresh** button in the **Step 2** section.

8. Underneath Step 2, select your **Microsoft Azure Directory ID** under which you created the QnA Maker service, select the **Azure subscription name**, select the **Azure QnA service**, and **English** as the **Language**.

    ![Connect your QnA service to your KB form is displayed populated with the preceding values.](media/qna-maker-connect-qna-service.png "Azure QnA service")

9.  Underneath Step 3 (Name your KB), provide a unique name, such as `ConciergePlus`.

10. Underneath Step 4 (Populate your KB), select **+ Add file**. [Upload this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/MCW-Intelligent-analytics/main/Hands-on%20lab/lab-files/faq.xlsx) to the service.

    ![On STEP 4 Populate your KB, the +Add file button is selected.](media/create-qna-maker-add-file.png "Knowledge base creation page")

11. Finally, underneath Step 5 (Create your KB), select **Create your KB** (keep **Chit-chat** at its default, **None**).

    ![The uploaded file from the previous step is highlighted in the File Name section of Step 4. Step 5, Create your KB, has the Create your KB button selected.](media/qna-maker-create-kb.png "Knowledge base creation page")

12. When the KB is being created, the Knowledge base will be displayed in the window. It takes a few seconds for the extraction process to read the Excel document and identify questions and answers.

    ![The Knowledge base screen displays a sample QnA question. Are pets allowed?](media/2019-11-25-05-37-13.png "Sample QnA Question")

13. Select **+ Add QnA pair** in the toolbar to add a new row in the **Editorial** section of the Knowledge Base. Enter `Hi` into the **Question** field and `Hello. Ask me questions about the hotel.` into the **Answer** field of the new row you created.

    ![On the Knowledge base screen, + Add QnA pair is selected from the toolbar. In the Source: Editorial context section, the question Hi that has the answer Hello. Ask me questions about the hotel. is highlighted.](media/qna-maker-created-kb.png "Knowledge base")

14. Choose **Save and train** button on toolbar of the page. This will save your changes and train the bot how to respond to questions, given the information you imported.

15. Once your changes have been saved, select **Test** at the top of the page. Try typing `hi` and press enter. You should see the **Hello. Ask me questions about the hotel.** response. Experiment with asking different questions.
